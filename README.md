The following files are broken down in terms of the specific functions they provide. No single file is enough to perform the complete simulation with an agent and a trivial policy acting on a time dependent environment.
The navier stokes environment is not porvided in a time dependent case in order to make it such you will have to simulate multiple solutions with different nt parameters.We reccomend varying nt with 10 each time starting from 0.
