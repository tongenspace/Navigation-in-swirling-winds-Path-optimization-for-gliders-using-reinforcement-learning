The following files are broken down in terms of the specific functions they provide. No single file is enough to perform the complete simulation with an agent and a trivial policy acting on a time dependent environment.
The navier stokes environment is not prоvided in a time dependent case. In order to make it such you will have to simulate multiple solutions with different nt parameters. We recommend varying nt with 10 each time starting from 0.
The video named "Simulation of time dependent_solution for real world data" compares the Trivial policy (green line) and the PQL agent (red line) for Vs=0.5. The two agents are trying to reach from Ruse to Burgas.
